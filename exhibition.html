                <h3>Cosmology</h3>
                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.</p>
                <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

            <article class="evolution">
                <h3>Evolution</h3>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution, we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
                <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved over time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                <h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.</p>
                <p>Life expectancy is much longer and quality of life improved thanks to medical advances. This exhibit explores the history of medicine including penicillin and the first heart transplant.</p>
                <p>Many medical discoveries have come from observing animals in the wild—not just labs.</p>
