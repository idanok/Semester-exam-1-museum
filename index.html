                <p>Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to making science accessible to
                    all.</p>
                <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind,
                    water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life
                    itself.</p>
                <p>The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our
                    discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world
                    around us.</p>
                <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to life through exhibits. This
                    is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many
                    of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around with to see science come to
                    life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).
